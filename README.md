Super Tic Tac Toe is a spinoff of the old school game, composed of 9 tic-tac-toe games arranged in a 3x3 grid. This game requires much more strategy to beat your opponent. In this repo, we are creating an AI opponent to devastate any opponent to play this game.

To best understand Super Tic-Tac-Toe you should read the rules, located in the rules.png file. Also, there is a brief example of gameflow in gameflow.png that will help out beginners. Those two files should be enough to get you started. If you need more assistance refer to the video in this link : https://youtu.be/37PC0bGMiTI?t=48
